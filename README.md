# Dagger Anypoint package

A [dagger](https://dagger.io/) module for building, testing and deploying Api specification and Mule applications (Api Implementations) to Anypoint platform. The module internally uses [`anypoint-cli`](https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-cli/3.x). 


## Installation
You can install the latest release with

```shell
dagger project update github.com/foryouandyourcustomers/dagger-anypoint/anypoint@<release>
```
If you want to work directly with `release` change the version to `main` or use one of the tagged releases 

### Usage & Examples

```shell
import github.com/foryouandyourcustomers/dagger-anypoint/anypoint
```
